# cutting-force-detection
This repository contains codebases for the model prepared for cutting force detection in end milling operation. 

1.  `mech sop- cutting force.ipynb` contains the code and an example that represents how the code works. This was submitted before midsem.
2.  `final sop.ipynb` contains the code and an example of the final model that was prepared.  This was submitted during the final presentation.
3.  All other files are the datasets that were taken from the lab researchers to train the model.
